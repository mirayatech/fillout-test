## Fillout Test

In this assignment, you’ll build a page navigation component like the one used in our form builder.

The goal is to bring the design to life in a way that feels modern and provides a great UX. There's no need for a backend.

### Feature requirements

* Show a series of form pages (e.g. “Info”, “Details”, “Other”, “Ending”)
* Support drag to re-order pages
* Support adding a new page between any two existing pages via a "+" button that appears on hover
* Open a context menu per page (rename, duplicate, delete - those buttons don't need to do anything though)
* Highlight the active page + allow selecting other pages

Maintain all state in memory (no backend required) and follow the visual design closely. Add subtle UI polish if you’d like to improve the UX — hover/transition animations, etc.
